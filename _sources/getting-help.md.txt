# Getting Help

Please use the [Google group for OSATE](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/osate "OSATE Google Group") to ask
questions about OSATE. This group is also a good place to discuss existing OSATE features and request new ones.

If possible, use a Google account to join the group. If you cannot use a Google account, send an email to the group
[osate@googlegroups.com](mailto:osate@googlegroups.com "Group Email") and ask to be added as a member.

Posts by non-members and by new members will be moderated.

See [Google Groups Help](https://support.google.com/groups "Help") for more information about Google groups, e.g.,
how to sign up, and how to post.

Note that this group may not be the best place to post general questions about AADL or the AADL language.
