New Installation
----------------

To install OSATE, download the archive file for your platform from the
OSATE download site (see below), choose an installation directory and
unpack the archive file there. The installation directory contains a
platform specific executable (osate.exe / osate.app / osate) that can be
used to start the OSATE.

Detailed Installation for Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

After downloading the appropriate zip file from the OSATE download site,
extract the zip file to an empty target directory, e.g., C:\\Tools\\OSATE.
After extraction the target directory will contain some sub-directories
and files, including osate.exe:

Additional steps for macOS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OSATE binary is not signed. This can result in an error message when
starting OSATE.

To correct this issue, run the following command to allow OSATE
execution:

::

   $ sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine osate2.app/

Additional steps for Linux
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Newer Linux desktop environments, e.g., Ubuntu 22.04, use Wayland as
an underlying technology. The AADL diagram editor in OSATE is not
compatible with this technology, and trying to use it will result in
a crash of the JVM.

As a workaround, run OSATE with the following command
(adapt if you are not using bash):

::

   $ GDK_BACKEND=x11 ./osate

Installing Additional OSATE Components
--------------------------------------

There are several optional components available for installation. OSATE
provides a convenient way to discover the available components and
install them via a dialog that is available in the ``Help`` menu.

This brings up a component installation dialog that displays the
available components. To install one or more components, select the
component’s checkbox and click on ``Finish`` to start the installation.

Updating OSATE
--------------

**This was available only for OSATE 2.2.1.**

An existing OSATE installation can be updated when a new maintenance
release has been published. We support updates within the same OSATE
version from the final release to a maintenance release and from one
maintenance release to the next. For example,

2.2.1.vfinal -> 2.2.1.vupdate01 -> 2.2.1.vupdate02 -> …

To start the update process, use the check for updates entry in the help
menu in OSATE and follow the instructions in the dialog.
